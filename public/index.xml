      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Annelise Koster a junior data science major at the University of Arkansas. My time is filled with schoolwork, an internship at my church, and mountain biking. I also enjoy to read - A Girl of the Limberlost, The Kitchen Counter Cooking School, and Educated are some of my favorite books. I created this blog as an assignment for my one of my programming classes and intend to use it to showcase various projects I work on throughout my school and work career.</description>

Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat are responsible for cleaning the original data. This dataset contains booking information for two hotels but since the hotels mentioned are real hotels any data pertaining to customer or hotel identification has been deleted.</description>
