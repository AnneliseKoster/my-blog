```{r}
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, tidy = TRUE)
```



```{r}
data_hotel <- read.csv(file = here::here("hotelbooking_data.csv"))

str(data_hotel)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
data_911 <- read.csv(file = here::here("911_data.csv"))

str(data_911)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
