I'm Annelise Koster a junior data science major at the University of Arkansas. My time is filled with schoolwork, an internship at my church, and mountain biking. I also enjoy to read - A Girl of the Limberlost, The Kitchen Counter Cooking School, and Educated are some of my favorite books. I created this blog as an assignment for my one of my programming classes and intend to use it to showcase various projects I work on throughout my school and work career.
