I'm Annelise Koster a Junior Data Science major at the University of Arkansas. I keep myself busy with schoolwork, an internship at my church and mountain biking. I also enjoy reading - A Girl of the Limberlost, The Kitchen Counter Cooking School, and Educated are some of my favorite books. I created this blog as an assignment for one of my programming classes and intend to use it to showcase various projects I work on throughout my school and work career.
